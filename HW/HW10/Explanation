First I have the TreeNode class implementation. Then we have the LevelOrder Method that
returns a 2D list which then calls the levelOrderHelper method. This method takes in the
root, 2D list, and the level as parameters, the level being each level of the tree and 0 
being the root level of the tree. The levelOrderHelper method creates a new arraylist in
each list if the level is equal to the size of the 2D list so that we have an arraylist for
each level of the tree. We then make sure to get the correct level (list) of the 2D list and
insert the node's data at that level. I then made two recursive calls to traverse each left 
and right child of the tree, making sure that we add 1 to the level if we are traversing
down each level. This then keeps adding the node's data to the correct level until the tree
is finished. Then there is the main method that includes the announced test case which tests
my code.
